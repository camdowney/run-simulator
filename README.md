# Run Simulator
A simple application that simulates a repetition of events (trials) until a success is reached. Each group of trials that ends in a success (run) is recorded in the table. 

The table is organized vertically by run length, indicated by the leftmost number in each row. The most common length run should always be 1-trial runs, then 2-trial runs, and so on. However, most trials will usually take place in runs of length = (100 / prob success) +/- prob success.

The original purpose of this app was to solve a statistics debate... both parties were wrong.
